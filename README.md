## Getting Started

## Workflow

1. **Prepare Your Prompt:**
   - Create a prompt by editing the topic section in the `prompt_template.md` file in this repo.
2. **Generate Slides with LLM:**
   - Use an LLM to process the custom prompt and generate a clean markdown file (e.g. `slide-deck.md`) containing the slide content.
3. **Review and Edit:**
   - Open `slide-deck.md` in VS Code with the [Marp VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) to preview and refine the slides.
4. **Export Slides:**
   - Convert your slide deck to PDF or PPTX using the Marp CLI tool:
   
   ```sh
    npx @marp-team/marp-cli@latest slide-deck.md -o output.pdf
    npx @marp-team/marp-cli@latest slide-deck.md -o output.pptx
    ```
   - (Optional) For an editable PDF, use [Adobeâ€™s online converter](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/pdf-to-ppt.html). Note that the layout may be slightly altered.

## Installation
